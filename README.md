Functions:
are composed of a name and parameters which is declared by a If statment 
Named parameters are named operations to use to shorten code 
Keyword arguments must come after positional arguments 
order of first two arguments is important and atfter that the keyword arguments can be in any order
If users want to pass in numerous variables they  use the astrisk (*args) short for arguments 
Keyword arguments are handled by a method called (*Kwargs) keyword arguments are stored as dictionary and not tuple( kwargs have keys and values that can be passed in any order make it appropriate  for deictionary )

Locals function allows us access to varibales in python

When python looks up local funtions it reads the local variables then the global
Variables as function:
the 'code ' function in python can be used to confirm that functions are just variables
Lambda functions are handy to pass other python functions
