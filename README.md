# Python-Week-2
Functions:
are composed of a name and parameters which is declared by a If statment 
Named parameters are named operations to use to shorten code 
Keyword arguments must come after positional arguments 
order of first two arguments is important and atfter that the keyword arguments can be in any order
If users want to pass in numerous variables they  use the astrisk (*args) short for arguments 
Keyword arguments are handled by a method called (*Kwargs) keyword arguments are stored as dictionary and not tuple( kwargs have keys and values that can be passed in any order make it appropriate  for deictionary )
Variables and Scope:
Locals function allows us access to varibales in python
Global functions allow us access to variables outside fdefined functions 
When python looks up local funtions it reads the local variables then the global
Variables as function:
the 'code ' function in python can be used to confirm that functions are just variables
Lambda functions are handy to pass other python functions 
Anatomy of a class :
Classes have attributes
static varibles are defined outside the constructor, sattic varibles can still be changed  programmers put an underscore before the variable name to inidicate that if should not be modified  direclty 
Class inheritence:
it possible for one class to inhert all the attributes and variables of another class
the original class will bbe refered to as a parent class, if a child class has a class with same attribute as the parent class the childs class will overide the parent class
list is actually a class in python
super() is used to call a instance of a parent class
Handling Errors:
Exceptions can be seen/determined during runtime and can be retried unlike errors , but alll in all errors and exceptions belong to the base class exception 
Finally will always execute irregardless of an exception 
rising error 
Customs Exceptions:
